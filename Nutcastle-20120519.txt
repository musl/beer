Began mash. Bags working perfectly. Mash smells really nice. There's
also rattatouille in the oven, so there's lots of rosemary in the air.

14:15
Concerned about mash temp being too high. It's hard to keep the temp at
the right point on our stove.

14:50
Stopped mash for dad. Poured hot water through the spent grain until the
batch hit 5.8 gal for the boil.

15:10
Stopped mash for mike. A simple squeezing brought my batch up to size. I
was surprised how much water was still in the grain.

15:45
Boil started for mike's batch. The foam on the top of the water looks
great and we anticipate a good creamy head, if you can make that
assessment now. Wish we had more than one long-handled spoon. Added 4 oz
of Black Treacle.

16:25
Boil started for dad's batch.

16:32
Added second batch of hopps to mike's batch.

16:45
Boil ended for mike's batch. Right at 5 gal. Sweet.

17:01
Started Nottingham yeast starter in 86F water.
Crash cooling began for mike's batch.

17:10
Added hopps to dad's batch.

17:15
Crash cooling ended for mikes batch. Racked to primary. Pitched yeast.

17:25
Boil ended for dad's batch. Right at 5 gal. Awesome.

17:27
Crash cooling started for dad's batch.

17:50
Crash cooling ended for dad's batch. Racked to primary. Pitched yeast.

18:20
Color's quite a bit darker than expected for both batches, especially
for mine, given the black treacle. I think that the reason the OG
readings came out so high is because there's a *lot* of grain dust in
the batch. I'm not sure if I should adjust the target FG, but I guess
we'll see how the beer behaves. If it shoots down to 1.013, we'll know
it's because the dust settled out. If it finishes up at 1.020-1.030
we'll know it's just error. Go figure.

20:30
Temp: 75+F
The yeast is visibly active, slow bubbling.

The house is a-rockin'. Both batches churning quite vigorously. I
suspect that the brew brothers' mill crushes the grain a bit too
well. All the fine grain particles settled out within a couple hours,
leaving 1/2" to 3/4" of sediment on the bottom of both carboys. The wort
on top was clear and a nice color, which I hope means the immersion
chiller worked well. By this morning though, the yeast had done a
fine job of stirring everything back up. Looks like we're about 0.017
off on gravity on average. That translates to about 2.2% Alcohol By
Volume. That's a lot, but that assumes we actually make it down to
the FG number in the recipe and that the readings were taken in clear
wort. I suspect we can safely subtract that error due to the suspended
grain particles that I should have let fall out before taking the
reading.

I think the Nottingham yeast was the right way to go. It's getting a bit
cooler in the house and closer to the target fermentation temp.  If it
stays too warm, we run the risk of the yeast putting out too many fruity
esters. That usually isn't a huge problem and gets better with a bit of
age. That said, it's usually good to have it in that range for the first
day or two to ensure a good start to fermentation. They're still rockin'
out, so I think that's been accomplished.

From the Danstar page on their Nottingham yeast:

- Quick start to fermentation, which can be completed in 4 days above 17°C.
- "The recommended fermentation temperature range of this strain is 14°
 to 21°C (57° to 70°F) with good tolerance to low fermentation
 temperatures [...]"

I'll see if there's some way I can cool the carboys down, but I really
don't think it'll be that big of a problem.

20:00
Temp: 74F
Fermentation Noticably slowed. 1.5" of sediment in the bottom of each
carboy. Beer was nearly clear. Shook both leaving some sediment at the
bottom.

Fermentation continues to slow. Most of the sediment has settled, and
there's a second layer of finer sediment that's settling as well. I
expect this batch to clear in a week and a half, well before the
bottling date of June 8.

The temperature in the house has been holding between 70-72F. I know
that's slightly warmer than the yeast calls for, but it's close
enough. The beer is still active, with an occasional bubble in the
airlock and small fairly frequent bubbles on the surface.

Gravity Readings!
Mine: 1.034
Dad: 1.032
estimated 4.6% to 4.8% ABV

That's still about 0.020 above the recipe. (1.013) Given that we were
off by nearly the same amount for the OG readings, I think there might
be a problem with my hydrometer. In spite of that, the difference
between the OG readings and the readings above indicates that the yeast
behaved as predicted. I'll take official FG readings again just before
we bottle to see if it dropped any further, but I don't think it'll drop
more than 0.002 (0.25% ABV) or so. Optimistically, that puts both our
batches right at 5%, exactly on target.
