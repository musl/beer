Master Brew Plan
================================================================================

- Do the math:

    Variables:
        - Batch Size            (5 gal)
        - Mash Thickness        (2.5 qts/lbs)
        - Mashed Grain Weight   (10 lbs)
        - Boil Time             (60 min)
        - Trub Loss             (0.5 gal)
        - Equipment Loss        (0.01 gal)
        - Grain Absorption      (0.13 gal/lb)
        - Percent Boil-off      (10 %/hr)
        - Prt. Rest Temp        (133 F)
        - Sac. Rest Temp        (152 F)
        - Mash Out Temp         (167 F)

    Stuff to Calculate:
        - Total Volume          (eg: 8 gal)
          Use the mash calculator, but add a bit extra.

        - Boil Volume           (BV, eg: 6.37 gal)
          Mash Calculator: "Pre-Boil Wort Produced"

        - Sac. Rest Water       (SRV, eg: 6.25 gal)
          Mash Calculator: "Mash Water Needed"

        - Sparge Water          (eg: 1.4 gal)
          Mash Calculator: "Sparge Water Needed"

        - Prt. Rest Strike Temp (eg: 137 F)
          Mash Calculator: "Strike Temperature"

        - Prt. Rest Water       (PRV, eg: 5.54 gal)
          SRV / 1.24

        - Step-up Water         (eg: 0.71 gal)
          SRV - PRV

        - Decoction Volume      (eg: 1.27 gal)
          BV - BV / 1.25

    Note 1: For this plan, it's easy to use the brew365 calculator,
    setting the target mash temp to the protein rest temp.

    Note 2: To calculate the amount of water you need for step 1 and
    decoction, you'll need the ratio to divide the volume by:

        (desired temp - current temp) / (212 F - current temp) 

- Water Prep:

    Clean out one or more kettles. Put the total volume of water you'll
    need water out over-night to de-chlorinate if necessary.

- Check ingredients:

    - Grain
    - Hops
    - Water
    - Yeast  

- Prepare the yeast starter.

- Add salts to the grain if desired for a different water profile.

- Clean, sanitize, and check equipment.

    - Mash Tun with Spigot
    - Grain Bag for Mashing
    - Boil Kettle
    - Sanitization Bucket
    - Auto-siphon and Tubing
    - Story Stick(s)  
    - Spoon
    - Hop Sock(s)  
    - Carboy
    - Hydrometer & Vessel
    - Sampling tool Bottle Wand or Thief
    - Cooling Towel

- Prepare protein rest water in the mash tun.

- Strike:

    Add grain to the mash tun, stir well to mix. Check and adjust PH if
    necessary.

- Protein Rest:

    Hold the mash tun at 55 C (133 F) for 20 minutes.

- Step-up:

    Prepare step up water in boil kettle. Plan ahead so that it reaches
    a boil just before the end of the protein rest.

    At the end of the protein rest, slowly add boiling water to the
    mash tun, stirring and taking temperature readings, stopping when
    the saccrification rest temperature is reached. Cool and add any
    remaining water to the mash tun.

- Saccrification Rest:

    Hold the mash tun at 66 C (152 F) for 60 minutes.

- Prepare sparge water. Heat to mash out temperature.

- Decoct:

    Prepare the decoction. Plan ahead so that it reaches a boil before
    the end of the sacc. rest.
    
    At the end of the saccrification rest, slowly add the decoction to
    the mash tun, stirring and taking temperature readings, stopping
    when the mash out temperature is reached. Cool and add any remaining
    wort to the mash tun.

- Mash Out:
    
    Hold the mash tun at 76 C (167 F) for 10 minutes.

- Vorlauf:

    Re-cycle wort across the grain until it runs clear, being careful
    not to disturb the grain bed. It will form a natural filter.

- Sparge:

    Drain the mash tun into the boil kettle. Gently pour the sparge
    water over the grain bed. When done, remove the grain bag and fully
    drain the mash tun into the boil kettle.

- Boil:

    Perform hop additions, grain steeping, and addition of fining agents
    as required by the recipe.

- Crash cool to 68 F as quickly as possible

- Aerate the wort:

    Ideally, I'd want to do that with a stone and oxygen tank. At least
    agitate the wort for a few minutes while racking it from the boil
    kettle.

- Pitch yeast.

- Primary Fermentation:

    Seal with an airlock filled with vodka or with a blow-off tube
    terminated in a bucket filled with sanitizing solution.

    Keep the carboy near 70 F for the first day. (or follow the
    recommended starting temperature guidelines for the yeast)

    Control fermentation temperature with a wet towel on the
    carboy. Keep the yeast at the low end of its fermentation range.

    Leave for 1-3 weeks, or until FG has been reached, which ever comes
    first.

- Secondary Fermentation:

    If necessary, rack to a secondary carboy and add adjuncts or dry hop
    it. Leave for the required time.

- Bottle:

    Clean and sanitize a bucket, bottles, capper, caps, auto siphon,
    tubing, and bottling wand.

    Prepare a priming solution with corn sugar or dry malt and put it in
    a bucket. Heat 1-2 cups of water to a boil.  As the water cools, add
    the proper amount of priming sugars.

        For example, to get 2.3 volumes of CO2 with a 5 galon batch at
        64F, use 3.73 oz of corn sugar or 5 oz of dry malt extract.

    Rack the beer onto the priming solution, while stirring gently.

    Use a bottling wand to fill each bottle, and cap.

    Clean and store all equipment.

    Box and store the bottles at 64F for two weeks. Place in cold
    storage after they carb up.
