19:30

Began brew day. Started with 6 gal of cold, filtered water. Cleaning and
sterilization commences.

20:20

Added 1tsp gypsum to 'harden' the watter a little. In 5 gal, that raises
the calcium content by about 60ppm. Water here is considered soft;
per the Tualatin Valley Water District report, at most about 57-120
ppm. Anywhere between 120 and 180 ppm would be hard enough for the
spirit of the recipe. It also helps accentuate the hops, for good or
ill.

20:55

Hit strike temp of about 158F. Began mash with 10lbs of maris
otter. Looks like with the large burner, I can maintain mash temperature
with short burns on the lowest setting. I've got three thermometers this
time, and I'm fairly confident that I'm within a couple of degrees of
152F, on the high side.

21:35

Added darker grains. At about 151F at the top, and about 158F or so in
the middle of the pot.

21:55

Ended the mash. Temp at the top: 149F, middle: 155 in the
middle. Volume: 5 gal. Added 1 gal cold filtered water.

22:53

Boil began. Added 1.5oz of Kent Goldings Hops.

23:30

Added the other half ounce of hops slightly early because I needed to
put 'em in a bigger bag. The pellets expanded more than I thought they
would. I ended up using the malt bag for the hops. Last time I felt that
I might have wanted to use just a tiny bit more hops, so this time it's
all two ounces. The black treacle was expired, so none of that in there
this time.

23:45

My yeast starter is *3* packets of danstar nottingham in warm
water. Better put 'er in the tub this time.

23:53

Boil ended. had to drain the hop bag. Not fun with the hot water, will
remember to buy hop socks next time. Volume: 5.2gal.

00:05

Began crash-cooling with the copper coil.

00:15

Wort's at 85F. Racked to primary while sloshing the wort around.

00:20

Pitched yeast. I hope the yeast hadn't gotten too cold waiting outside
while I crash'n'rack.

00:52

The wort tastes nice, though I hope that the hop isn't too powerful down
the road. I'm pleased that the mashing went much more smoothly. I'm also
pleased that I'm within 0.005 of my target original gravity. I might
still have had the temp a bit too high at the bottom of the pot. I think
the pot cozy is sounding like a fantastic idea, since I didn't need to
turn the burner on very often during the mashing. In playing around with
Brew target, it turns out that I'm *spot on* the original gravity number
for having an extra pound or so of 2 row. Forgot I made that alteration
to the recipe! I'll have to take that into account when I take my FG
reading.

FG after two days: 1.014 Wow. Nottingham is aggressive! It looks like
adding the dark grains to the last 20 minutes of the mash did exactly
what I wanted it to do. We'll see after it conditions.
