Boiling until I hit 5.5 gal, or the gravity lines up.

Gravity reading 1.022. Still actively fermenting. Fermentation temp
held steady at 70 F for the first 24 hours, as recommended by the yeast
mfr. After that we put a wet shirt on the carboy. This has kept the
temperature between 66 and 68 F since. Removed the shirt, and it's still
holding around 68 F. It's pretty much on track for about 53 hours.

15:14

Gravity reading: 1.020, ABV 4.46% so far. I've been putting a wet towel
on the carboy to keep the temp around 66-68 F.

Gravity reading: 1.019. ABV 4.59% so far. Moved to the garage. It's 53 F
in there right now. I plan on leaving it in there for about a week to
settle. Hopefully it isn't too cold, but the yeast is supposed to be
tolerant of temperatures down to 54 F. In any case, it should be warmer
during the day in there, and I'm not sure how much I trust the garage
door thermometer anyhow.

The calculated SRM value matches the visual approximation. The taste
test revealed a slight natural carbonation, forward hops, good malt
character, and a tiny bit of sourness again. It's not like lacto, or an
infection, but it's still really young. We'll see what it's like after a
time.

Read a post or two about nottingham. Aparently temp control is really
important, and should be between 60-62 F. I'm still fermenting high.
Also folks mention a sourness is common with it.
