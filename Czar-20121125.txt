19:15

Water reached strike temp. Began mash. Mashed with 5 gal of water and
everything *barely* fit in my brew pot. I'm concerned that the
extra-thick mash will affect my efficiency. We'll see.

19:45

Added dark grain. The mash is averaging 150F at the top & middle. That's
about 4 degrees lower than called for, but I suspect that even with all
of the stirring, the bottom of the pot is a couple of degrees hotter.
I'd rather undershoot and come out on the dry side.

20:25

Opted to mash 10 minutes longer since the mash was so thick.

20:57

"Pot sparged" up to 5.75 gal. Ran cold water into the grain bag and into
a second pot, combined the two. Man, that was unwieldy. I found myself
wanting a 15-20 gallon brew pot and a collander or press large enough
for my bag.

21:41

PB sample hit 60 F. 1.086. Not bad!

21:50

Boil started. Added 2oz Horizon Hops.

22:40

Added 2oz Kent Goldings Hops.

22:45

Added 1.35oz (all Brew Brothers had left) Kent Goldings Hops.

22:50

Boil ended. Drained hop socks. Ended up with 4.75 gal.

23:10

Crash cooled to 85 F in about 10 minutes.

23:20

Racked about 2 gal onto the old yeast cake and shook it to thouroughly
mix the yeast and wort. Racked the remainder into the clean
carboy. Racked the yeasty wort onto the rest of the wort.

23:33

OG sample hit 60 F. 1.098 on the money! Huzzah! 

23:40

Cleanup finished. Added 2.5 tsp yeast nutrient. Capped the carboy and
put it in the tub. Here's to a rockin' fermentation!
