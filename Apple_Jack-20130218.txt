Measured applejuice gravity. Added 0.5 gal of little bastard wort
(Pre-boil gravity 1.036) and started heating to a boil. Preboil
volume: 1.5 gal.

Boiled down to 1.25 gal. 

15:20

Added 1 tsp yeast nutrient and 0.5 tsp pectic enzymes to the bottle,
added must and aerated.

15:45

Pitched yeast, capped.

The galon jug is too small for a reading with the hydrometer. It hits
the bottom of the jug. Fermentation has been slow, and I'm considering
dumping another pouch of nottingham in there.

The jug has been in our closet for a couple of weeks now. It's not
bubbling much, but fine bubbles are still occasionally rising out of the
trub.

Made a starter of champagne yeast and added it to the jug, I'm a bit
paranoid that it's not reaching the desired gravity.

I don't think the champagne yeast took, and it hasn't appeared to have
much of an effect on the cider. It's a tad cloudy.

Took the final gravity reading and slowly poured the cider into a
1-gallon food-grade malt extract bucket. Placed the bucket in the
freezer. Woot.
